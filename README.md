# Temporal-Dynamics-of-Qualification-Rates
This study elaborates on and extends the work of [1], which employed the POMDP framework to investigate how qualification rates evolve under the influence of
institutional decisions and individual actions. <br>
The original research observe the long-term implications of imposing various fairness constraints on diverse subgroups within a population. 
It concluded that short-term fairness measures may not necessarily translate into long-term equity and that the outcomes can differ depending on the underlying feature distributions and transition dynamics. <br>
In an effort to deepen the understanding of these results, this paper present the sketch proofs of [1]’s core findings. 
Additionally, we introduce an expanded model that incorporates the effects of external interventions, such as community programs and mentoring initiatives, on qualification states. <br>
This enhancement provides a more nuanced and comprehensive perspective on the temporal dynamics of qualification rates.
